# Apex Monitor
A small, short program I am currently writing in order to do some things
> Teach myself `pyautogui`
> Automate certain aspects of Apex Legends

Now that I am able to find things on screen, I plan on automating end game screenshots if my team has gotten over `x` amount of kills in that game for the purpose of video editing and flexing.

## Usage
Install the packages from requirements.txt and then run whatever folder you want. It isnt finished yet so you will need to go through it and run it function by function

## Bugs (I am aware of)

> To use the program you must run it on the same display as the game, this display must also be your main display

> The current armour detection wont detect 'your' armour if you are not alone, due to teammates and no built in anti collision or logic, yet.
